# Proxies: Define your proxy servers here
proxies:
  - name: "MyProxy"                     # A name for your proxy
    type: http                         # Type of the proxy (http, socks5, etc.)
    server: "192.168.1.35"             # Your proxy server IP address
    port: 3128                         # Your proxy's actual port number
    # username: "your_username"        # Uncomment and set if your proxy requires authentication
    # password: "your_password"        # Uncomment and set if your proxy requires authentication
    # tls: false                       # Set to true if the proxy server itself uses TLS (HTTPS proxy connection)
    # skip-cert-verify: false          # Set to true to skip certificate verification for TLS proxies

# Proxy Groups: Define how proxies are selected and used
proxy-groups:
  - name: "PROXY_GROUP"                # Name of the proxy group
    type: select                       # Type of group (e.g., select, url-test, fallback)
                                       # 'select' means you can manually choose a proxy from the list
    proxies:
      - "MyProxy"                      # List of proxies in this group (referencing names from 'proxies' section)
      # - "DIRECT"                     # Optional: Add DIRECT for direct connection without proxy
      # - "REJECT"                     # Optional: Add REJECT to block traffic

# Rules: Define how traffic is routed
# Clash matches rules from top to bottom. The first matched rule takes effect.
rules:
  # Example rules (uncomment and modify as needed):
  # - DOMAIN-SUFFIX,google.com,PROXY_GROUP  # Route all google.com traffic through PROXY_GROUP
  # - DOMAIN-KEYWORD,example,DIRECT         # Route traffic with 'example' in domain directly
  # - GEOIP,CN,DIRECT                       # Route traffic to Chinese IPs directly
  # - DST-PORT,80,PROXY_GROUP               # Route all HTTP traffic through PROXY_GROUP
  # - SRC-IP-CIDR,192.168.1.101/32,DIRECT   # Traffic from a specific source IP goes direct

  - MATCH,PROXY_GROUP                     # Default rule: All other traffic goes through PROXY_GROUP
                                          # Change PROXY_GROUP to DIRECT to have direct connection as default
